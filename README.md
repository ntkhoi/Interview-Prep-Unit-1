## Topics: Strings and Arrays

* Arrays: ordered lists of items often used for sequential lists
* Strings: sequences of character data.

### Required tasks

**Strings**
- [X] Read String Questions in Interviews.
  - Strings are immutable . String variable will be destroyed and re-created every time a new character is added to it. Lessons learned :We should care about program's performance when Manipulating string in loop. 
  - Solution : Create a buffer large enough to store and compute with string . 
- [X] Watch [Memoization and Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I) video
  - Memoization ensures that a function doesn't run for the same inputs more than once by caching record of result in memory for given inputs  
- [X] Watch [Anagram Problem Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwRGPPB4tw) video
  - Before codeing . First define what exactly broblem . Define what input and expected output . Struct code break functionality before start coding.

**Arrays**

- [ ] Read Sorting Algorithms
  - I read [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/tree/master/Quicksort) about quick sort and insertion sort 
- [X] Watch [Introduction to Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkkFqlG0Hds) video
  - I learn basic of sorting, what is sorting and when use that.
- [X] Watch [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) video
  - Using a few sentences, describe what you've learned

**Coding**

- [X] Set up `exercism` and complete at least 2 exercises using `exercism submit`.

### Optional tasks

- [X] Do more tasks on exercism
- [X] Set up an account on Interviewbit.com and start the [Programming course](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
- [ ] Finish [Time Complexity chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity) in Level 1 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Arrays chapter]((https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/)) in Level 2 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Math chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/) in Level 2 of Interviewbit.
